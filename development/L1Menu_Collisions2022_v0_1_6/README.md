**Comment:** New version of the menu in view of Run3. Adding 2 new seeds:
- L1_HTT200_SingleLLPJet60 (#153)
- L1_HTT160_SingleLLPJet50 (#154)
which belong to the same request (JIRA ticket: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-963) as seed L1_HTT120_SingleLLPJet40 (#24).

[Scale set reference, for grammar version 0.10]

**NOTE:** The default behavior of the script sets the prescales of seeds using NotBptx or Bptx to zero. This is due to problems emulating NotBptx in ZeroBias. If you wish to include the prescale information for these seeds, use the --includeBptx option.
